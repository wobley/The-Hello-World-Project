The-Hello-World-Project
=======================

This project has been inspirated by a person who once made the following statement: "I have programmed in all programming languages". After some hesitation and confusion, I came to the conclusion that what this person meant was "I have written Hello World in all programming languages". Conforted by this realisation, I have decided to put together an incremental collection of Hello World programs. 
I am aware of an existing GitHub project (https://github.com/leachim6/hello-world) and the Hello World Collection (http://www.roesler-ac.de/wolfram/hello.htm) and by no means I would like to compete with such well established initiatives. Mine would like to be an indipendent pet project aimed at completeness over a long period of time. Contributions are most welcome!
